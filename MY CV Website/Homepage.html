                My name is Mohammed Wasif Sarwar and I am the sole developer of this website. <br />
                In this website, you will learn all about myself, my skills and why I am a good candidate for any potential employer. But before you consider me,
                I must begin with a short introduction of myself.<br />
                I was born on the 7th of October in 2005 and I am 19. I spent my whole life in the vibrant city of Dubai, UAE. Currently, I am a first-year undergraduate
                student at the Aston University,UK where I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science. In 2024, I graduated from Cambridge International School with
                flying colours. My academic life at school was always filled with excellence and I am sure I will be replicate my earlier success to fulfill
                any employer's expectations of what they want for their company. Filled with a natural curiousity for computers and software, as well as mathematics,
                I have always excelled in these two subjects and my problem-solving skills are ready for whatever challenges are thrown my way.

                <b>Cosmologists Try a New Way to Measure the Shape of the Universe.</b> <br /> <!-- Bolded article title -->
                Is the universe flat or infinite? Or is it a completely unknown shape? <br />
                This depends on the critical density of the Universe, a fundamental cosmological constant. But physicists are now trying something completely different.

                I wish to be a software Engineer and work for the developement of humanity. I wish to improve existing software frameworks and work to use software to the developement of education. I plan to learn Android and IOS and thus be able to program and be versatile
                in a wide variety of software environments. However, I also love mathematical physics and plan to pursue that in the future and thereby make many important
                contributions to mathematics and computer science. I would love to work on quantum computing in the future.
