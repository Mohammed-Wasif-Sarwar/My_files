                On this page, you will find out where I was educated during my school life and where I am currently.<br /><br />
                <strong style="font-size:30px;">IGCSE</strong> <br /><br />
                I graduated from Cambridge International School Dubai with honours in both my IGCSE and AS as well as A-level examinations.

                I gave my first board exams in June of 2022 and achieved 7 A*s in a wide variety of subjects, from Mathematics, all the physical sciences and Computer Science to English First Language and English Literature, further validating my proficiency in the English language.<br />

                AS and A-Levels<br />
                <br />
                During my AS and A-levels, I took 4 subjects: Computer Science, Further Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. I studied Cambridge A-Levels for Computer Science and Further Mathematics and Physics and Chemistry as Oxford AQA A-Levels.
                In Computer Science, I selected the Python programming language and was able to gain a basic understanding of OOP programming in Python during my A-levels. I also studied a wide range of topics in Computer Science from AI to operating systems and a basic functionality of how computers and their internal components work.

                From Further Mathematics, I was able to learn polar coordinates and linear algebra as well as advanced probabilistic statistics. I also learned advanced mathematics necessary for a successful computer scientist during my course of AS and A-levels. I successfully completed the A-levels with 4 A stars with more achievements during this period.
