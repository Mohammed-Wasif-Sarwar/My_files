            Quantum computing is surely going to become the future of computing as will AI. Therefore, it is essential to become proficient in learning AI fully and as deeply as possible before being able to tackle possible
            limitations on quantum computing. The age of quantum computers and the need for one has brought forth a new computer race among nations and without learning more about quantum computers

            <div style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif; font-size:30px;">Learn mathematics and physics in great detail.</div>
            My goal to dive into AI and quantum computing is in perfect tune with my ambition to learn mathematics. I would love to master mathematics at a higher level and pursue my love for physics as the use of quantum
            mechanics is a necessary tool for quantum computers. I also would like to spread the message that mathematics is not hard. I would end with a quote from John von Neumann:
            <em>"If people think mathematics is so difficult it is because they do not realize how complicated life is"</em>
