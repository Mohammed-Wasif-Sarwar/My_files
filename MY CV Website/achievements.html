            This was my first external board examination award from Oxford AQA and indeed from any board I ever gave an exam in. It was awarded for exceptional performance in the May June 2023 Board Exam. For this, I was
            awarded the Top In Country, Top In Region and Top in World for getting the highest exam score in the world for Physics AS Level. This award shows my dedication to other subjects besides Computer Science.

            I was the school topper during my IGCSE exams in 2022 and in both the AS and the A-level examination. In IGCSE, I achieved 7 A*s and I topped the school in IGCSE Mathematics. In AS-Levels I got 4 As and in my
            A-levels I got 4 A*s in Further Mathematics, Computer Science, Physics and Chemistry, and heaping glory on that, I topped the school in all of the four subjects. It was a defining moment in my education and
            shows how versatile I am in a wide variety of subjects.

            This was my first external board examination award from Cambridge CAIE for my top performance in the May June 2024 exam for scoring the highest marks in A Level Further Mathematics. This award was given for
            an exceptional performance across 2 years for top-scoring in both the AS and the A levels of Further Mathematics, thus further showcasing how versatile I am as a potential candidate.

            Coding is one of the main skills that will help me as a successful programmer. In the future, I would love to code in a wide variety of languages cementing my role as a competent programmer. I would also like
            to achieve a high rating on CodeForces. At present, I am able to code in Java, Python, Processing as well as able to do intermediate front-end developement.

            I love Mathematics and Physics. In my spare time, I study Mathematics and Physics Undergraduate books myself, as I wish to work as on quantum computing in the future. I love physics in the sense that it is so
            beautiful in describing our natural universe and mathematics for its wonderful variety of subfields, especially number theory. I am already highly proficient in some areas of mathematics that will help me as
            a computer scientist.

            Problem solving is an important part of computer science jobs and I pride myself on having a focus on particularly difficult problems, refusing to give up when I know that there is a solution to the problem. There
            are many times in computer science when a particular piece of code may or may not work but I always try to use my critical thinking sets and reference my books to find the best and most efficient solution to the
            problem.
